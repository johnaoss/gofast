# gofast

Check your network specs from the menu bar.

# Building

To run this project, run `make` while in the root of this repository.

This was tested to work on macOS Catalina Beta (19A546d).

# Roadmap

Actually implement the project. Deciding on either using `fast.com` or the internal macOS network speeds, but that requires me to write some Objective-C which I'd rather not.

# License

Please check [[LICENSE.md]] for information about the license.

# Acknowledgements

This project is mainly based off of [caseymrm/menuet](github.com/caseymrm/menuet), a macOS menu bar library.
