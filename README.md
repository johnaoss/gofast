To run this project, run `make` while in the root of this repository.

This was tested to work on macOS Catalina Beta (19A546d).

# Roadmap

Actually implement this project, and then also add macOS entitlements. If I have the money lying around,
I may try to get this in the Mac App Store.

# Acknowledgements

This project is mainly based off of [caseymrm/menuet](github.com/caseymrm/menuet), a macOS menu bar library.
